/*The Run menu provides menu options that are grouped into six sections.


1. Start and stop applications: This section of the menu includes options for starting and stopping code execution, with and without the debugger attached.

2. Launch configurations: This section of the menu provides access to examine or create launch configurations.

3. Runtime control: This section of the menu enables the developer to control how they want to advance through the code. Controls are enabled when execution has paused during a debug session.

4. Set Breakpoints: This section of the menu enables the developer to set breakpoints on code lines. Code execution pauses on Breakpoints during a debug session.

5. Manage Breakpoints: This section of the menu enables the developer to manage breakpoints in bulk rather than individually.

6. Install Debuggers: This section of the menu opens the Visual Studio Code EXTENSIONS view filtered for code debuggers.
